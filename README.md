# Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_Machine_Learning
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for breast cancer detection using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to classify breast cancer cases effectively. Techniques such as multiple regression and classification algorithms are applied to achieve high accuracy in detecting malignancies. This project serves as a foundational exploration of machine learning's role in medical diagnostics.
